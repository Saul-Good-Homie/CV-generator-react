# CV/Resume Builder (React)

## Project Overview

In this project I use React JS to create a simple CV builder. There is no storage or backend connected. The purpose of this project to practice the React JS framework to create reusable components, functional component, state and props, handling inputs and rendering lists.

This is a project from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)

The styling and basic functionality was inspired from Brad Traversy's [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)
